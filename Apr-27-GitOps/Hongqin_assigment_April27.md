Kustomize:

I have never heard of it before, learning Kustomize through this Gitops tutorial is my first experience. I learned what is a YAMI file and Kubernetes manifest. I can use commands like "kustomimz build" and "kustomize edit" to build a manifest and apply changes to a manifest without modifying the original files. When it comes to deployment, I learned how to use Argo CD to deploy manifests. Personally, I like Argo CD a lot because I am not a terminal person, being able to deploy manifests through a tool or application with a clean and formatted user interface makes my life much easier.

Kafka:

Also, never heard of it. 
I learned the definition of Apache Kafka which as a well-known platform for building data pipelines, visually interpeted what a AMQ stream look like in detail. I l also learned how to create a Kafka cluster for deployment by working on a yaml file. I worked with Kafka console to produce and consume records, had an experience on sending messange via console.
