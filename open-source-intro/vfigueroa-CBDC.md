I learned about Project Hamilton from a guest lecture in IS 815 by Jim Cunha the Executive Vice President of the Boston Federal Reserve. In class and this video/paper, the Fed talks about the potential for a decentralized central currency. It could enable instant payments, unlike the current ACH transfer method which can take days or weeks to be cleared. Additionally, the current system has some fundamental flaws. For instance, ATMs can pull your account information to allow you to withdraw money but there's a chance that the information they have access to is old. You might have made a purchase with a debit card and the ATM hasn't been sent this transaction so it loads a balance that is higher than what you have. To prevent you from fraudulently withdrawing too much money many ATMs that aren't owned by your bank impose withdrawal limits.

I would recommend learning this open-source project because even if it doesn't end up being adopted by the Fed it might pave the way for a new way of banking and moving large transactions instantaneously across the globe.
