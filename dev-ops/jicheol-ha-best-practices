Agile Project Management: Agile teams focus on delivering projects and work in small, frequent increments rather than in large masses. 
Requirements, plans, and results are updated and responded continously. Agile management is divided largely into four steps: to do, in progress, code reivew, and done.

Implement Automation: Continuous delivery and implementation allows developers to merge code regularly. Using CI/CD, this process can be automated. 
Automated testing is also necessary for a successfull DevOPs, including end-to-end testing, unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests.

Observability: The three pillars of observability are logs, traces, and metrics. 
Logs is a time-series data of the performance of an application.
Traces track the sequence of logic in the application.
Metrics refer to CPU/RAM reservation or usage, disk space, network connectivity, and more.
Observability helps to make useful predictions or discoveries about a running application my using all three pillars, which would otherwise be a very complex process.
