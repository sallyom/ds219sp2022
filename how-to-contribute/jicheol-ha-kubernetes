In Kubernetes, one can get involved with Sig Docs, which is a group of people who publish and maintain Kubernetes documentation and website. 
People can also easily request changes through a pull request or open other issues about documentation.
One can also join the Kubernetes Community Site, in which they can participate in Twitter, Stack, or learn about events, meetings, and other activities.
